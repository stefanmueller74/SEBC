# Describe the boot camp: was it useful, difficult, simple?

* Very great, a lot of fun. Very useful yet difficult, but challenging. 
* Very good preparation for my project work.
* Very good to run in all the traps of everyday live as an installer.

# Which topic was least familiar to you? Which topic was most familiar?

* Linux, databases, hdfs are most familiar for me.
* Kerberos was least familiar for me.

# Which topic did you feel was most helpful? Which topic was not useful, if any?

* Kerberos was most helpful obiviously.

# How long before you are ready to to install a production cluster by yourself? What do you need to work on?

* I think 2 weeks of hard work with lots of input. I have done a lot of installation on linux/unix/windows (big databases, etl tools) over the years.

* Security with Kerberos and deep dive into Cloudera Manager
* update my overall installing skills to the latest developments
